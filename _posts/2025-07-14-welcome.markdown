This site has two main purposes: to serve as a professional portfolio for my academic work and to be a space for me to share more personal thoughts on my blog.

You can navigate to what interests you most:
- **Academic Work:** For my CV, published papers, and research projects.
- **Personal Blog:** For my reflections on academia, hobbies, and everything in between.

I'm happy you're here and I hope you find what you're looking for.
